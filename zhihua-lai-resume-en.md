I am currently a Senior Software Engineering in [AFO (Azure For Operators)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/azure-for-operators-afo-research/) in [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) where I contribute and build high performance software (C, eBPF) that run on 5G Base Stations.

During the employment with Amazon, I have contributed to development of several large scale distributed applications in the domain of AWS (Amazon Web Services) e.g. [S3 Simple Secure Storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). I have worked from Day 1 at [S3 Object Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/object-lambda/) and witnessed the [successful launch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-s3-object-lambda-use-your-code-to-process-data-as-it-is-being-retrieved-from-s3/) of it (Mar-18-2021).

During the employment with General Electric, I have added the \_while loop, regular expression, http library, jwt APIs and many other features to the Magik compiler ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magik_(programming_language))). 

During the employment with Ranplan Wireless, I have designed and implemented the cutting-edge Intelligent Radiowave Propagation Engine that is pushed to its limits by using Win32 inline Assembly in the core. See [https://ranplanwireless.com/](https://ranplanwireless.com/)

In High School (2002), I have won the third prize on NOI programming contest i.e. National Olympiad Informatics.

I am a [TOP 3 Witness](https://steemyy.com/witness-ranking/) aka Block Producer of the Steem Blockchain. I am beknown for the contributions (infrastructure, tools, API and services) to the Steem Blockchain. See [https://steemyy.com](https://steemyy.com)
